<p>These are just some notes for myself.</p>

<h4 id="academic-writing">Academic writing</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Overleaf for online editing.</li>
  <li>TexStudio for local preferred editor.</li>
  <li>TexLive as my LaTeX installation</li>
  <li>VSCode as an alternate beautiful editor and use LaTeX workshop package. With LaTeX workshop package you get Overleaf like setup which works well on widescreen monitors. I still find TexStudio and its feature for locating text in .tex from preview pdf very useful. I believe this feature is missing from LaTeX workshop as of now? I like to use solarized dark as my theme of choice. I typically 15 font size with default of fonts.</li>
  <li>When I use Google docs, I like to use PaperPile for managing my citations.</li>
</ol>
