These are just some notes for myself.

#### Academic writing

1. Overleaf for online editing.
2. TexStudio for local preferred editor.
3. TexLive as my LaTeX installation
4. VSCode as an alternate beautiful editor and use LaTeX workshop package. With LaTeX workshop package you get Overleaf like setup which works well on widescreen monitors. I still find TexStudio and its feature for locating text in .tex from preview pdf very useful. I believe this feature is missing from LaTeX workshop as of now? I like to use solarized dark as my theme of choice. I typically 15 font size with default of fonts. 
5. When I use Google docs, I like to use PaperPile for managing my citations. 
6. While I usually make TikZ figures from scratch, I sometimes use Matcha: https://www.mathcha.io/editor I think the code is not super readable or maintainable or editable, but, suffices for the quick and dirty stuff.
