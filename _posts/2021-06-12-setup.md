# Setting up a new Mac

Here is a screenshot.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/setup.png "Here is how my terminal looks after the configuration")


I will now discuss how I setup a new Mac. I use homebrew. It makes it very easy to maintain all the packages up to date. 


### Install homebrew and some pertinent packages

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

Install fish shell

`brew install fish`

Make fish default

```
sudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/fish >> /etc/shells'
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```


Install git

`brew install git`

Install powerline fonts

```
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts
cd fonts
./install.sh
```

Use powerline fonts in shell

Go to Terminal -> Preferences
Change font to powerline
I am using Roboto Mono Light Powerline 18pt


git clone git://github.com/stephenway/monokai.terminal.git
open monokai.terminal
(set this theme as default)

Install fish theme

`omf install bobthefish`

Install Zoom

`brew install --cask zoom`

Install Firefox

`brew install --cask firefox`


Install VSCode

`brew install --cask visual-studio-code`

Install OBSStudio

`brew install --cask obs`

VLC

`brew install --cask vlc`

wget

`brew install wget`

anaconda

`brew install --cask anaconda`

anaconda path setup in fish

`./usr/local/anaconda3/condabin/conda init fish`

Install MacTex (slow!)

`brew install --cask mactex`

Installing TexStudio
`brew install --cask texstudio`

FFMPeg
`brew install ffmpeg`

Imagemagick
`brew install imagemagick`

Ghostscript
`brew install ghostscript`


Install pandoc

`brew install pandoc`

# Setting up an iPad for programming

## Using the WorkingCopy App

WorkingCopy is a very nicely made Git app on the iPad. 

I'll let the pictures do the talking.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-2.png "WorkingCopy App interfaces nicely with the Files app!")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-3.png "WorkingCopy App can nicely show the diffs")


## Setting up the terminal app (a-Shell)

First, after installing a-Shell, I like to set the font size, terminal background and foreground color. Here is how the a-shell app looks like


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/A-shell-initial.png "a-shell on the iPad is my favourite app!")

`config -b black -f white -s 20`

Sometimes I like using vim for editing documents and interfacing with WorkingCopy. a-Shell provides vim!

I like to setup a `bookmark` to the WorkingCopy folder so that I can direcly edit files in that location.

I do so by:
writing `pickFolder` in a-Shell and setting it to WorkingCopy folder. Now I can set a bookmark to this location. I do so by: 
`bookmark git` in the current location (set by pickFolder)

## Editors

I use one of the following for editing:

* Koder App
* WorkingCopy App
* vim (in a-Shell)

# Setting Linux/Mac machine and iPad for Python programming (via Jupyter notebooks)

On the Linux/Mac (remote server) machines I set up Jupyter notebooks as follows:

First, I create the configuration file via: `jupyter notebook --generate-config`

Next, In `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` change

```
python
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*'
c.NotebookApp.port = SET YOUR PORT
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
```

Set password using:
```
jupyter notebook password 
```

Run notebook as:
```bash
nohup jupyter notebook& 
```

On the client end (iPad in this case), I use one of the following two ways to access remote Jupyter instances:

* Using the Juno Connect app
Juno connectly nicely saves all the configuration and can do the necessary port forwarding

* Using Safari and opening the remote Jupyter URL
Just open the remote URL with the set port number. I use my workplace recommended VPN client to get into my workplace network and access non-public IP based servers.

# VNC connection

I tried a few VNC software and found AnyDesk to work fairly well. I did a bunch of small settings tweak.
* I setup a password on my remote machine for uninterruped access 
* I put AnyDesk in the login items on my remote machine so that it starts when the system boots

# Email client

I like the Spark app. The interface is pretty clean. Plus, it has a bunch of keyboard shortcuts making it nice to use with an external keyboard. 

# PDF management

The iPad Files app is a fairly well made app. Perhaps not as functional as the Mac Preview app, but, does some things well.

For instance, merging multiple PDFs is easier (for me) than doing the same on Mac. One just needs to select multiple files and then "right" click to "Create PDF"

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CombinePDF.gif "Combining PDFs is trivial on the iPad using Files app")

I use the following ffmpeg command (inside a-Shell) to create this GIF courtesy this excellent tutorial from [GIPHY folks](https://engineering.giphy.com/how-to-make-gifs-with-ffmpeg/)

```bash
ffmpeg -i Video.MP4  -filter_complex "[0:v]  fps=12,scale=720:-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen [p];[b][p] palette
use" CombinePDF.gif
```

Another alternative is to use the [following shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f9a9c2cc6e61476abf2e35f654869553&xcust=1-1-232739-0-0-0&
) to convert the screen recorded video into a GIF
