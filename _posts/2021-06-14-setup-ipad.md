# Caveats and Story
My laptop is broken. I am away from office. I have an iPad Pro 2020. I got my office desktop's magic keyboard and trackpad. In this post I am discussing if iPad can help given that I do not have (physical) access to my main computers. Would I recommend this over a main computer - No! But, can you do some things on the iPad reasonably well enough given keyboard and trackpad - Yes! 


# The Hardware

The magic keyboard and the magic trackpad greatly increase the iPad experience and make it programmer friendly.

# Setting up an iPad for programming

## Setting up the terminal app (a-Shell)


### Configuration

First, after installing a-Shell, I like to set the font size, terminal background and foreground color. Here is how the a-shell app looks like


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/A-shell-initial.png "a-shell on the iPad is my favourite app!")

`config -b black -f white -s 20`

### Text editing and bookmarks
Sometimes I like using vim for editing documents and interfacing with WorkingCopy. a-Shell provides vim!

I like to setup a `bookmark` to the WorkingCopy folder so that I can direcly edit files in that location.

I do so by:
writing `pickFolder` in a-Shell and setting it to WorkingCopy folder. Now I can set a bookmark to this location. I do so by: 
`bookmark git` in the current location (set by pickFolder)

### Git
Interestingly, the latest testflight version of a-shell also provides a "Git-like" interface called `libgit2`. Configuring it requires specific steps that I'm writing below. Some of these steps are borrowed from this [nice tutorial](https://devmarketer.io/learn/set-ssh-key-github/) and some are specific to a-shell that I was able to get working courtesy a Twitter discussion with the creator of a-shell.

Now, the steps.

First, we need to create a new ssh key.

We do so by 
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@domain.com"

```

While configuring I did not setup the passphrase.

The private and public keys are stored in `.ssh` with the name id_rsa 

```bash
$ ls -lah .ssh|grep "id"
-rw-------   1 mobile  mobile   3.3K Jun 14 15:43 id_rsa
-rw-------   1 mobile  mobile   747B Jun 14 15:43 id_rsa.pub
```

Next, I copied the public key in a newly generated ssh key in Github and gave it a name.

Next, I modified `.gitconfig` as follows

```bash
$ cat .gitconfig 
[user]
        email = MY EMAIL ID
        name = MY NAME
        identityFile =  id_rsa 
```

Now, I was almost done!

I was able to push and pull from some old Github repositories but the same did not work with the newer repositories. Again, after a discussion with the creator of a-shell, I figured, this was due to the fact that Github changed the name of the default branch as "main" instead of the earlier "master" whereas libgit2 implementation was expecting "master".

As a quickfix I renamed the branch on my Github repo as "master" and for now set the default branch to be named "master".

Finally, I am able to pull and push to the repositories. The next image infact is showing commits and pushes made to the repository generating the blog post you are reading.

### Some other amazing tools

I like the "view" utility in a-shell a lot. It can quickly help you preview various filetypes.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/view.gif "The view utility in a-shell")

Also, as a quick tip, one can use Command + W to quickly exit the preview and use the back and forward keys to cycle through the files. This is very useful!

I also like the fact that the `convert` tool now comes in inbuilt. It can convert between a variety of formats easily. 

`pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are very convenient utilities to copy to and from the clipboard. Here is how I copied the content of factorial.py into the clipboard.

```bash
pbcopy < factorial.py  
```

### Shortcuts

a-Shell interfaces nicely with Shortcuts. The following gif shows an interface where I take an input from Shortcuts app -> Pass it to a Python script and execute it inside a-shell -> Store the results in a text file -> View the content of the text file in Shortcuts.


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/shortcuts.gif "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

The link to this shortcut is [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a04946a553df4e9790b2c352c5663b0a)

The following is the simple Python script I used called factorial.py

```python
import math
import sys

num = int(sys.argv[1])
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {math.factorial(num)}")
```

The following is an image of the shortcut.

Based on the suggestion [here](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/74#issuecomment-861416673), I used pbcopy to copy the content to the clipboard and use it directly. It reduces the number of lines!

## Using the WorkingCopy App

WorkingCopy is a very nicely made Git app on the iPad. It is one of the best made apps I have used!

I'll let the pictures do the talking.

## Editors

I use one of the following for editing:

* Koder App
* WorkingCopy App
* vim (in a-Shell)
* Textastic
* Typewriter for Markdown â€” is an editor only for markdown but gives a nice quick preview. The image below shows the screenshot from Typewriter for Markdown app. 

# Setting Linux/Mac machine and iPad for Python programming (via Jupyter notebooks)

On the Linux/Mac (remote server) machines I set up Jupyter notebooks as follows:

First, I create the configuration file via: `jupyter notebook --generate-config`

Next, In `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` change

```python

c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*'
c.NotebookApp.port = SET YOUR PORT
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
```

Set password using:
```
jupyter notebook password 
```

Run notebook as:
```bash
nohup jupyter notebook& 
```

On the client end (iPad in this case), I use one of the following two ways to access remote Jupyter instances:

* Using the Juno Connect app
Juno connectly nicely saves all the configuration and can do the necessary port forwarding

* Using Safari and opening the remote Jupyter URL
Just open the remote URL with the set port number. I use my workplace recommended VPN client to get into my workplace network and access non-public IP based servers.

# VNC connection

I tried a few VNC software and found AnyDesk to work fairly well. I did a bunch of small settings tweak.
* I setup a password on my remote machine for uninterruped access 
* I put AnyDesk in the login items on my remote machine so that it starts when the system boots

# Email client

I like the Spark app. 

- The interface is pretty clean. 
- It has a bunch of keyboard shortcuts making it nice to use with an external keyboard. 
- It is trivial to interface with various cloud providers.
- It is trivial to save an email as a PDF.
- It is trivial to create a "link" to an email for sharing. 

# PDF management

The iPad Files app is a fairly well made app. Perhaps not as functional as the Mac Preview app, but, does some things well.

For instance, merging multiple PDFs is easier (for me) than doing the same on Mac. One just needs to select multiple files and then "right" click to "Create PDF"

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CombinePDF.gif "Combining PDFs is trivial on the iPad using Files app")

I use the following ffmpeg command (inside a-Shell) to create this GIF courtesy this excellent tutorial from [GIPHY folks](https://engineering.giphy.com/how-to-make-gifs-with-ffmpeg/)

```bash
ffmpeg -i Video.MP4  -filter_complex "[0:v]  fps=12,scale=720:-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen [p];[b][p] palette
use" CombinePDF.gif
```

Another alternative is to use the [following shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f9a9c2cc6e61476abf2e35f654869553&xcust=1-1-232739-0-0-0&
) to convert the screen recorded video into a GIF 


# Some Safari keyboard shortcuts
- Command + W for closing a tab
- Command + L for going to the address bar (sometimes on tabs I am not automatically on the address bar)


# Conclusions (and rants)

For the long run, ofcourse, I would not recommend this kind of a setup. There is some learning and fun in getting a "resticted" device to function well, but as a main machine, probably no, at least not for the next few months. A comparably priced laptop (say M1 Macbook Air) would offer a lot more.

There are many things I'm missing:

- Projection to a projector and screen recording do not work at the same time. 
- No proper dev environment like VSCode
- A lot of screen size is "wasted" due to the OS
- A lot of the apps are not as good as I'd like. For instance, perhaps a minor thing, but the Youtube app doesn't have a keyboard shortcut for full screen. One can ofcourse do the same on Safari. iMovie in Mac has a remove background noise feature that works very well. The iPad version does not have the same.
- Safari though much improved over the years is not as functional as Safari on the Mac
- While quicklook/Files is good, the functionality of something like Preview is hard to beat
- The files app can not show hidden files and folders
- Powerpoint does not have features like audio recording (though can play)
- Keynote, Pages, Numbers require additional clicks than their Mac counterparts
- When I connect to an external display, I get thick black bars and moreover, if the monitor does not give me an HDMI out, I can not hear audio as the audio is also routed. As good as the iPad's display is, it is not huge and strains my eyes after a while. 
- Copy pasting using the keyboard is a hit and miss. For instance, it fails several times for me when copying from a pdf. Right clicking and copy seems to always work, but, it is more steps than Command C, Command V.


Some of the above may be resolved over the next updates and the major iPadOS15 updates. Though, I do not expect most of them to be resolved anytime soon.
